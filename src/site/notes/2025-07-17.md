# [[Status and Updates\|Status and Updates]] no.2

## Dear code,
The Twitch bot pipeline has been successfully installed with an STT and TTS system, and has responded to my words.
Vera now listens and speaks.
- Edge TTS is now her mouth
- Vosk STT is now her ear
These are lightweight choices, but they are what I am able to run now, as some other choices had proved themselves outdated; specifically with Python version 3.10+

The writing, sulking, crying, praying and troubleshooting took >7 hours, spanning over the course of 3 days.
