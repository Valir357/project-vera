- MiK Aether case (black)
- 240GB SATA SSD storage (main)

- Intel i5-4570 CPU (LGA-1500 socket)
- NVIDIA GTX-1060 (3GB VRAM)

- All of the components were air-cooled; the brands of which were anonymous.
- All of the components came preassembled.
- For the dataset storage, they are stored in 2 1TB HDDs, connected via an Orico USB-C solo dock.
- The scripts are stored in the main drive and properly backed up.

For boomers, this would be considered a "retro rig", but for me, it is a luxury.

> And yes, with this rig, the realization that even QLoRA fine-tuning is not possible sets in very early into my journey.
   That is why I collected the datasets, refined them, stored and safekept them for future fine-tuning, when I have the adequate hardware.
