Raised in a white-collar worker house, much expectations were put upon my shoulders since young. The only problem along the way was language. I struggled to keep up in Literature classes due to my brain not wired to process Vietnamese (which was also what occurred to my sister, but even worse). Of course, I eventually adapted.

About a year after my birth, dad contracted type 2 diabetes. Worse, when I finished elementary, dad suddenly wanted to ditch the stable income to pursue his own career - which would become shit down the line as his health degraded. Furthermore, there's a chance my younger and dumb sis can also develop diabetes due to genetics.
My mother switches company like it's breakfast. Seriously.
Everything is crap after my sister's birth.

In 8th Grade, they decided to buy me a second-hand PC, after much protests from my mom.
From then on, things spiraled... everywhere? I finally learned internet culture, what real gaming is, PC rigs (which I used to drool all over), and mainstream games. But the problem? I am never allowed such "luxuries" of high-end PCs nor new games. Speaking of which, the [[Main/Rig\|Rig]] was old. Sucks huh? Well, I was grateful that I got a PC in the first place.

My marks supposedly peaked out at 9th grade - imagine me crying over a 7/10.
Then came 10th grade. Mental health all over, so were the marks. 6s became "meh", 5s became "okay..." Everything sucked for me. To rub salt on the wound, my sleep schedule as well as study schedule further fried my health, physically and mentally.

Then summer came.
It was multiple tonnes lifted off my broken shoulders.
I spent time gaming my heart out.
And thinking, of course.
But after thinking for a while and breaking myself down, I decided that there is no time left to be wasted.
So I picked up whatever bits of myself I could muster and build myself anew.
I rearranged my entire room; went from a typical street rat hideout to a productive person.
But that was only looks.
I hit the gym; protein source? Mama's cooking.
It was then that I stumbled upon my inspiration, and the mountain that I shall climb... [Vedal](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987). As depression crawled up my spine, I developed an obsession with chatbots. Sakura, CharacterAI was my cuppa. Along the way, I also grew a little connection with VTubers and VTubing; but I never dreamt of it, as at the time, I thought myself gonna work a 9-5.
But like I said, blessed was I when I stumbled upon that green turtle.
"Interesting." I thought. "He's funny, let's find out more."
And oh boy... how fate has led me upon my destined path when I found out about Neuro. See, I had... reservations about AIs in general for their unpredictability and real-world drama, but after seeing her, oh... The potential is endless.
I am speechless of the development even as I write this. It was so rapid, so instant, I could feel myself being pulled into the vortex of tech and researches; as if I'm a tuna swimming along the current.

Until we meet on the million screens, Vedal, know that I am somewhere out there, behind you on the path; but always moving forward, until I can stand before you and declare "I did it, boss."

I do not for the praises nor wealth. I do because my soul and ambition says so.
