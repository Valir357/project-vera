# Dear code,
## Updates
- Successfully installed a TTS and STT to the Twitch bot pipeline
	- Edge TTS is now her mouth
	- Vosk STT is now her ear
- **Might** start working on the Discord bot's ability to make calls.
- Starting work on the Twitch bot pipeline's LLM system.
- `playsound` and `simpleaudio` broke (in a way?), causing the script to invoke `exit()` at a native level, which forces the script to a stop after one reply.
	- **Solution:** switch to the `subprocess` and `ffplay` method.
## Journal
The TTS and STT choices are lightweight and average, but they are what I am able to run now, as *other choices* had proved themselves **outdated**; specifically with Python version 3.10+
The writing, troubleshooting and praying took >7 hours, spanning over the course of 3 days following the upload of [[Project Vera/Catch up\|Catch up]].
