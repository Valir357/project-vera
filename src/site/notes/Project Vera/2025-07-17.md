## Dear code,
The Twitch bot pipeline has been successfully installed with an STT and TTS system, and has responded to my words.

Vera now listens and speaks.

- Edge TTS is now her mouth
- Vosk STT is now her ear

These are lightweight choices, but they are what I am able to run now, as some other choices had proved themselves outdated; specifically with Python version 3.10+

The writing, sulking, crying, praying and troubleshooting took >7 hours, spanning over the course of 3 days.

Update: since `playsound` and `simpleaudio` somehow broke, causing the script to invoke `exit()` at a native level, I switched to the `subprocess` and  `ffplay` method instead.
It worked, much to my utmost relief and joy.
