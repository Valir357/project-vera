### Bug report:

The STT seems to be too... *sensitive*, as it can pick up the faintest of noises from my headphones. This is probably a hardware problem, not internal, since attempts at disabling the mic ***internally*** has proved useless; while disabling it ****physically**** proved otherwise.

This will be annoying if I were to use it  in an actual stream; luckily, my time has yet to come and there's still time for improvements.
