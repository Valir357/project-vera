Got me a new PSU.
The problem?
It's from Thailand, and produced in Chinese.
Initial red flags included chipped Molex connectors and an obvious anonymous brand.
But I spent the money, so I used it.
Well...
...the 256GB Colorful SSD's power connector got fried.
But luckily, I had Vera backed up in full in a USB, so what I lost was only the environment - which... I expect will take a long, long time to reinstall.
After that, I got myself a better component (see in [[Main/Rig\|Rig]] )
