I attempted in creating [a Twitter bot like NeurosamaAI](https://x.com/NeurosamaAI), but unexpectedly, X/Twitter requires you to pay just to post text-based posts using their API. It is a feature included in the "Basic" tier; while I am on "Free" tier.
Safe to say that the Twitter bot will have to be halted for a long, long time.
