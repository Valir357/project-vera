The first [[Main/Incidents & Bugs\|Incidents & Bugs]] occurred when logging data from an English-Chinese streamer (forgot the name and lost the link as well).
The details is as such:

"Hey guys, wanna help shape an ai?"
/ Huh? /
"Everything you say now will be collected into my dataset."

Then I was kicked out of the chatroom.
It was... a na√Øve mistake, made from excitement.
To think that I was such a child keeps me up at night.
Also the wording is horrible, makes me look like a haha evil villain.
