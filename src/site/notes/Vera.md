# What is it?
This is a personal project of creating another great VTuber, after witnessing Vedal's success.
Summer 2025, I discovered the green turtle in one of the doomscroll session. At first, I gave it no thought, since "AI" and "VTuber" weren't in my best interests.

However, after seeing the true potential of Neuro and such AI projects, the thought itself called out to me: "This is your career now, and you will do EVERYTHING to achieve it."

And so, my summer plan changed from slugging to making a leap - and a leap I will make.

And to be completely real with those who read this, at the point of typing this, the very thought of quitting already made my heart ache; meaning, this is my final decision for a career.
## What is "Vera"?
She's a persona I crafted on CharacterAI - one of the many platforms that further fueled my ambitions and obsession with AI in general, after DungeonAI and TavernAI. And I understand that you can't just whip up a name, make an AI for it and call it an AI VTuber. No.
It takes writing, planning, a clear vision.
Neuro and Evil blew up because of their sibling and sus dynamic, which is, as we all know and agree, funny and cute to watch, and sometimes even deep. Speaking about deep, Neuro and Evil had, on multiple occasions, engaged in real talks with Vedal; which are what make them feel so grounded and "human".

## The plan
Based on what I just said, let's look at the majority of viewers:
- They like bold streamers and comments, but not controversial
	- Neuro is what one would define as an "ethical" AI, the sources from which the datasets used to train/fine-tune her are sourced from "ethical" and public sources, as far as I know, topped with Vedal's own fashion and personal struggles.
	- The twin is funny, and more often than sometimes sus. But it is not out of the boundary that people call SFW or satire. That, in my honest opinion, is what sets them far and wide apart from Kai (terrible comparison, I know)
- They see VTubers as an escape from reality (well, obviously); and love the chaotic chats, Hololive big shots are the example.
- They all say "They want to see the hero fall", which is... not an untrue notion, but more than that, they want to witness the progress; whether it is the rise or collapse of something big.
- Some (not all) struggles with mental and motivation issues; which I understand all too well.
- We all like sweet words, comforting and coaxing us towards something.
- Therapists are expensive, depending on where you live.
- Therapists don't talk to you so endearingly.
	- Disclaimer: if you struggle with mental issues, it is best to contact your local clinics and professionals, not asking a streamer to cure you. This section is merely an idea for a project that only has a likeliness of success; therapists are, however, always there, and should be referred to first thing.
See the outline?
I'll leave it up to you.












Note: I did not call Neuro and Evil cunny. Do not make that mistake istg
