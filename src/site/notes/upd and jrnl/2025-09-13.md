# Dear diary,
### Week 1 recap
First week, nothing much. just getting used to the minimal tempo so next week I can add more weights - extra lectures, nightly studies, weekend classes...
In general, everything adds up so that I only have a Sunday to rest.
Of course, it's daunting, it always is.
But no goals are achieved without firsthand pain; and I am only getting started.
