# Dear code,
The plans have improved; and since we are aiming towards a different group of audience, I have decided to use COEIROINK as TTS.
Updates soon.

## Updates
- Started work on COEIROINK TTS system

## Journal
Is it normal to feel... **numb**? Especially this early on?
It's been only nearly 3 months, how can I feel numb this early in? Lack of motivation? Laziness? A burnout? Can't be; I've only done so much. Must be a childish episode of "Ooh I'm so tired, I must playyyy."
I need to slow down.
I need to take a look.
I need to focus.
I'm a junkie. An adrenaline junkie.
And I need to do something.
