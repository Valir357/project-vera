# Dear code,
Today is the day I **start**
No more dilly dallying, no more *"54 minutes"*.
Let's get to work.

## Updates
 - Swapped out Mistral 7B for Shisa V2 Llama 3.3 70B for full Japanese compatibility with the COEIROINK v2 TTS
 - Started work on Twitch bot's STM pipeline renovation.

## Journal
Like I said, it's about time I start running again. No more limping. No more 5m in bed.
The first steps were simple - instead of playing games late into the night, sleep. And instead of resorting to such things, flesh out a schedule that won't fuck up myself.

Dad has been forgetting things recently; early-set Alzheimers? Slim chance, but not impossible. But it is not a chance to fret or frown. It is a sign that I must ***start running***.

2025, Vedal turned 21. He debuted in 2022 - when he was 18. If he can do it, I can, too.
Vedal, born 10th Febuary - Aquarius. I, born 31st January - also Aquarius.
According to the [16 Personailty Test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test), Vedal is a Logician (INTP-T), and I, an Advocate (INFJ-T).
We are *different*, one way or another, but when the goals align and the will matches; I *will* be where you stepped - behind or ahead.
This is not obsession with Vedal nor a spontaneous and short-lived motivational rant; it is to show that where I am not the best at showing my will through words, I make up for in action.
*Because I do it not for the money nor the validation that I craved; I do it because it is my purpose, one that I've found and pulled myself onto amidst the dark. One that **resonates.***
