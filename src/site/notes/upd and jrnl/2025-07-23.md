# Dear code,
Today's a day of a small victory.

## Updates
- Successfully deployed *COEIROINK V2* TTS via API method. The work took ~6h, spanning across 1 evening, 1 night, 1 morning, and 1 afternoon; with the help of Google Translate.
- The audio is now played via `simpleaudio` - faster than `ffplay`+`subprocess`, but the problem of audio file not deleting itself after playing returns. Will need further troubleshooting.
	- The invocation of `exit()` is no longer a problem, for some reason.

## Journal
Through small actions like **planned** chores and studies, I took the first step towards self-betterment.
It is small, but significant - like a baby's first step.
It is a start.

Funny moment: it took me 2 hours to figure out that the **engine** of *COEIROINK V2 came with the main download folder, under a subfolder ***"engine"***, and that the `error 400` I had been having was not due to syntax error nor anything host-side; but that I hadn't started the server engine. Imagine the breath I released when I figured it out.
