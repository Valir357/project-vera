# Dear diary,
##### September, a new start, a month of revving up.
Starting a semester/year is painful for most of us, I've been there, I know.
But to change, we must accept that **starting** in general is hard, painful at times, even. That acceptance is the first step, one that I've already taken; I have accepted that I was in pain, I needed to rise up - by myself or by a hand raising me up. The latter wasn't properly given, so it was a predestined path on my side.
But do remember this: You're not alone. Even when you're standing by the balcony outside, wind and moon your "only" companion, there are still someone who'd want to see you again. Make it your mission to find them.
In that, you'll find a reason, a purpose.
*"Open your heart to the world, and you'll find every reason to keep living in it." -Laufey the Just*

So... shall we go?
