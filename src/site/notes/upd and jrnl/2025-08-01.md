# Dear code,
New month, new achievement.

## Updates
- Successfully wired in a *(very limited)* STM system.
	- It counts:
		- 5 interactions with Twitch chat
		- 10 interactions with speaker / me / mic
		- (*one back-and-forth = 1 interaction*)
	- Then feeds it to the in-session LTM system for further... **processing**.
- Alas, the system is very limited, crude, and untrustworthy. The AI managing the LTM vault sometimes doesn't exactly do its job. But I am content with the results.
- Transitioning to Twitter bot.

## Journal
I'm thinking about jobs recently.
To be specific, I'm finding jobs that gives me time while pays well enough for me to initialize savings while also covering the spendings. 'Bout time I think ahead of the game, no?

If you ask what I'll do with the money, the first thing is to get stable housing and food. Then I'm beelining towards building a proper workstation. Seems simple, but even now, I'm scratching my head over the choice of jobs available; in other words, I dunno what to do after College/University.
Btw, I'm aiming for a spot in Digital Communications major.
