# Dear diary,
### 4-week catch up
The pc had grounding problems. Self-diagnosing and fixing took 4 weeks. But much transpired during that time.
### Week 7 recap
The last 2 weeks were... mentally taxing. I could almost feel my mind sliding across a floor, but the floor is a giant cheese grater.
Mother got a job, but no more than 2 weeks later she quitted.
I want to say she's weak and giving up but... who am I - and in what position am I - to do that, really?
But with this diary back on, and some lessons learnt the painful way, I expect the march to realign.
