# Dear code,
As of ~end of June 2025, there are two platforms that Vera is present in: [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), and [Discord](https://discord.com/) - both are in form of chatbots
### Twitch
Vera is able to read Twitch chat and reply to it via the terminal, not in the chat room. It consists of 120 lines of code - clean, FDA-approved. The has a built-in prompt system to tweak its personality and reply style at will.
STT, TTS and memory functions are yet to be included.
I am still figuring out RAG and autonomous capabilities, stay tuned.
### Discord
This was a mini, side-project I embarked myself on, lasting 2 weeks and bore acceptable fruits. It was the same as Twitch, but Vera's able to actually reply into the room, not just to the terminal. STM is successfully utilized, with the limit set at ~15 msgs per person, persists across restarts. This will make the ground work for its inclusion in the Twitch bot.
LTM and RAG are yet to be figured out.
The side-project had concluded about last week, from the point of writing this.

### About me
My health has improved a ton since starting.

I don't cry to myself anymore.
My physical performance is... good(?). 180cm/5'11" tall, weigh 82kg/181lbs, run speed cap out at around 16kph/9mph. Kinda a racing tank, no?
I can bench 58 kilos/128lbs. I don't do deadlifts; not yet anyways.

Music has always been a dear companion since 9th grade.

At the same time, I'm saving up money.
