# Dear code,
As of ~end of June, there are two platforms that Vera is present in: [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), and [Discord](https://discord.com/) - both are in form of chatbots
### Twitch
Vera is able to read Twitch chat and reply to it via the terminal, not in the chat room. It consists of 120 lines of code - clean, FDA-approved. The has a built-in prompt system to tweak its personality and reply style at will.
STT, TTS and STM are yet to be included.
I am still figuring out RAG and LLM, stay tuned.
### Discord
This was a mini, side-project I embarked myself on, lasting 2 weeks and bore acceptable fruits. It was the same as Twitch, but Vera's able to actually reply into the room, not just to the terminal. STM is successfully utilized, with the limit set at ~15 msgs per person, persists across restarts. This will make the ground work for its inclusion in the Twitch bot.
LTM and RAG are yet to be figured out.
The side-project had concluded about last week, from the point of writing this.

### About me
It has been about 11 weeks into my journey. My health has improved a ton since starting.

I don't cry to myself anymore.
My physical performance is superb. 180cm/5'11" tall, weigh 82kg/181lbs, run speed cap out at around 15kph/9mph.
I can bench 58 kilos/128lbs. I don't do deadlifts; not yet anyways.

Music has always been a dear companion since 9th grade. My favorite? Generally, Fontaine and Flag (by Wakana). And out of my gym playlist is "Che Sia Vita O Morte"

No; I love Ultrakill, its fanbase, its vocaloid, its activities, but I don't play the game. Same can be said for pretty much all of the mainstream games as of summer 2025.
Yes, I have access to platforms like Reddit, X/Twitter, Youtube, and such. But there are things I stay away from: Instagram, TikTok, Locket (wtf is that even).

At the same time, I'm saving up money.

To conclude, one can say I am still a newborn baby in the coding world, but to tell you, I can pretty much understand all of the programmer memes already.
And no, no, no, I have yet to obtain the sacred programmer socks nor the right to own one.
