# Dear diary,
### Week 10 recap
For once, I had some head space.
Had some good rests, fine meals, much-needed quality time for myself.
It's a reset among resets, to actually wind down and prepare.
Truly, one must recognize and make the most of that time when it comes, 'cause otherwise, you won't even know you had a chance to breath before the tide swoops in again.
