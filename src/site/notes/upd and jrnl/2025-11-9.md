# Dear diary,
### Week 9 recap
I survived the week.
I never thought of using that term again but here we are.
At the end of the week I had a little sit-down with just myself, a cup of coffee, and my thoughts.
That one-hour long sitting was much needed; and desired. Cleared most of the weight on my mind.
- Oil up the engine and get it running.
