# Dear code,
I decided to flesh out my intended roadmap. Not to just let myself see where I headed and come back to to rethink, to also cast some light on where I ***will be***.

## Journal
Had to go with my younger sis to the airing of *The Smurfs* movie today. There's not much to say about kids' movies; but then, the deeper meaning of the movie kinda slaps.
To summarize, the movie is about a **nameless smurf's** journey to discover his true purpose in the village. At first, the notion of him being the "Magic Smurf" was denied by even the Papa Smurf himself. But typical kids story, he turned out to be the Magic Smurf after identity and emotional development, and saved the day.

>*"It may not seem like it, but you will never find out until you try."* Was what I told myself after leaving.

There are moments in life where you find yourself exhausted of ideas and somewhat lost. At then, you have 2 choices:
- You stop, think, strategize, then continue on.
Or
- Just wing it; but this doesn't mean blindly walking into the darkness ahead.
	- Know thyself, know thy foe.
