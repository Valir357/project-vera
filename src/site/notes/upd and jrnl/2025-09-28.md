# Dear diary,
### Week 3 recap
I am slacking, but I felt it coming - afternoon classes feel heavier, occasional head-on-desk eepy.
I need to diagnose this time, rather than ignore it - what happened? What went wrong in my personal schedule?

On the other hand, so far, ever since I started following a system I created for myself, procrastinating and missing assignments are no longer an issue - a big plus.
Now, let's see how long I can keep it up - and hopefully, I can do it til' the end of semester, since I now gained some familiarity with this rthymn.
