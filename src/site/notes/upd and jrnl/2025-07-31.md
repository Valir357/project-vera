# Dear code,
There has been much change over the span of 1 week.

## Updates
- Finished work on Twitch bot's LTM system
  To explain it, my LTM consists of 2 layers, which can be simplified as "in-session" and "cross-session", both are managed by a separate AI.
- Transitioning to STM construction.

## Journal
Mother's about to quit her job due to quote unquote "stress".
It is evident, it is - her temper recently is shorter than Tyrion Lannister, snapping at any minor inconveniences. But still, why do I feel like I don't buy it?
What I truly mean is that, why do I feel like she's targeting me and little sis for no reason? And she expects us to not be upset when she shouts profanities at us.

This is getting more and more like a concentration camp by the day; gassed by the atmosphere thicker than Lizzo and heavier than Caseoh, and the constant shouting, mocking and stress dump.
