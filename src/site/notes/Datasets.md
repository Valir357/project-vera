The datasets are "harvested" and/or downloaded from online sources, namely:
- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- And more websites

To answer the word "harvested":
- During the earliest months of my development (2025), I wrote a script that basically logged the Twitch chat from any active streams and convert them into a raw text file.
- From there, I turn them into the JSON format with a few modifications of my own.
