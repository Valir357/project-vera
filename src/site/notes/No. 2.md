The 2nd [[Incidents\|Incidents]] occurred when giving Vera a voice - called via API from ElevenLabs.
The problem stemmed from the fact that I used it on the Free Tier, which SIGNIFICANTLY limits the number of words I have in a MONTH.
As a result, I departed from 11Labs to seek out a cheaper or free alternative.

It is an insignificant incident, yes. But it had an impact on my newbie and fragile little baby pride.
