As of July 13th, 2025 (GMT-6), I have successfully whipped up two bots, a Twitch chat bot, and a Discord chatbot; both worked using the APIs and the bot calling method, hosted by OpenRouter/OpenAI.

- The original Twitch chatbot was made at the end of May 2025 - taking 2 weeks to plan and (adequately) assembled/written out. Testing, debugging and troubleshooting took another 5 days before becoming nicely functional. Vera had a voice, had. For the reason, check Incidents no.2.
- The Discord bot was made at the end of June 2025, as a self-assigned, mini side-project apart from the Twitch chatbot, after remembering Vedal's little advice in [his website](https://vedal.ai/advice/) (thank you, Vedal)

Above are the original statuses of each bot at the point of making.
